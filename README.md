Power BI Data Analysis Project

1.📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Hospital Emergency Ward Dashboard built using Power BI.
The dashboard analyzes emergency ward performance using key metrics such as patient volume, waiting time, admissions, demographics, village-wise distribution, and department utilization.

The goal of this project is to support data-driven decision-making for hospital management by identifying trends, bottlenecks, and improvement areas.

2..📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains emergency ward records for the years 2023 and 2024, including:
Patient Id ,Patient Admission Date, Patient Gender, Patient Age,
 Adress, Department Referral, Patient Admission Flag,Patient Satis
⚠️ Note: In this report, the column are created for Visualizatuion purpose (KPIs)

3.🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Metric	Value
Total Patients	9.216K
Average Waiting Time	35.26 minutes
Average Patient Rating	5.0
59.32% of patients are treated After Waithiing More than 30 minutes 
Treated within 30 Minutes	is 40.68%
Insight:As there is delay in treating and More Waiting time it directly effected on Patient Stisfiction 


4.🏥 Admission Analysis
Admission Status	Percentage	Patient Count
50.04%(4,612) of Patients Got Admmited
Not Admitted	49.96%	(4,604)
Insight:  Admissions and non-admissions are evenly balanced, reflecting effective triage and emergency screening.

5.👥 Gender Distribution
Male: 51.05%
Female: 48.69%
Others: 0.26%
Insight:Emergency ward usage is almost equally distributed across genders.


6.🏨 Department-wise Patient Distribution
Department	           Nor Patients
Unknown	                ~5.4K
General Practice	      ~1.8K
Orthopedics       	    ~1.0K
Physiotherapy	          Lower volume
Other Departments	      Minimal
Insight:Genral has More Patients followed bt


7.📆 Day-wise Patient Trend

Highest patient volume: Saturday
Moderate volume: Weekdays
Slightly lower: Sunday
Insight:Weekend staffing should be optimized due to higher emergency demand.

8.⏰ Hourly Waiting Time Analysis
Observations:
Peak waiting times occur during:
Early morning (06:00–08:00)
Afternoon (14:00–18:00)
Late evening (20:00–22:00)
Lower waiting times observed during late night hours.
Insight:Time-based staffing and resource allocation can significantly reduce waiting times.

9.✅ Key Conclusions
Waiting time remains a key challenge, especially during peak hours.
Emergency ward manages high patient inflow with bad satisfaction levels.
Village-based analysis reveals geographical concentration of demand.
Data quality improvements are required for department classification.
The dashboard provides strong support for operational planning and policy decisions.
